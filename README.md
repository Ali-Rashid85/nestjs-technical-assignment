# NestJS Technical Assignment

## Description

This assignment will help in assessing your technical skills. From Typescript syntax to code structure, appropriate coding principles and design patterns, and last but not least proper and relevant test coverage.

## Project

An employee management software, nothing fancy it's just a simple API with a little bit of advanced features to showcase your skillsðŸ˜Ž and knowledge of the NestJS framework.

- Integrate with the OpenAI API (use ChatGPT to generate the emails sent to employees when the check in for attendance)
- The project should be containerized and running in docker

## Submission

**All features must be fully and properly tested!!!**
